how it is displayed during the game. Once you've entered your name, hit "enter" to continue.

You'll then be asked to select a character type (class). Case sensitivity does not matter for program functionality,
but however you type in your character type is how it will be presented to you for the rest of the game.

The Mage is a magical class, focused on spells and enchantments. In game, look for typical magic weapons such as wands
to strengthen your magic points.

Attack Points: 30
Magic Points: 120

The Priest is a balanced class, but better with magic than with brute force attacks. You'll have more
health points than the Mage, but not as much as the Warrior.
In game, look for typical magic weapons such as wands to strengthen your magic points.

Default values for the Warrior are:
Health Points: 70
Attack Points: 20
Magic Points: 70

## ITEMS AND SPECIAL ITEMS ##

Items can be catagorised as Weapons (items) or Special Items. Special Items include Keys for access to specific areas
of the map, and are only obtained after beating a specific enemy that is guarding the relevant key.

Special Items also include the Restoring Liquid

All other items except potions are equipable, and can be equipped by using the "equip" command when not in battle.
Any item that starts with "Legendary" will have higher stats than the basic version of that weapon.

You start the game with no weapons, and two potions.

## KNOWN BUGS ## (updated 31 08 2023)

on defeat, game restart = yes calls "enter name" but then game closes
need to limit amount of restoring liquid available from north east dessert
need to limit access to gourda castle and lighthouse without getting key first
"locked" areas are currently accessible without the relevant key


## FUTURE PLANS ## (updated 31 08 2023)

- Include Status Effects
- Give enemies weaknesses based on player class (such as magic, or specific weapons)
- Defense stats, which can be modified by equipping a shield or relevant spell
- Special/Critical Attacks
- Weapon Variations
